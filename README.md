# Noise-Removal-in-ECG-Signal

To capture the accurate information from the input signals received from the
electrodes, unwanted signal noises are filtered out by the digital signal processing techniques. Electrodes (transducers) are placed at specific positions on the human body to record an ECG signal. In the process of the measurement of ECG, there is a possibility that various artifacts (noise), which are the unwanted signals, are also recorded along
with the signal. Artifacts are merged with ECG signal and sometimes create obstacles for the physicians from making a true diagnosis, consequently may cause a wrong diagnosis
or misinterpretation of the vital cardiac parameters. Hence, it is necessary to remove artifacts from ECG signals using proper signal processing methods.
